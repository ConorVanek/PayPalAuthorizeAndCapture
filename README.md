# PayPalAuthorizeAndCapture
PayPal button Proof-of-Concept, with intent of authorizing the payment and capturing later.

PayPal button is written using HTML and Javascript, inserted into a database using PHP, and payment is captured using a C# forms program.

C# code was part of a Visual Studio project, which is not included here. Nuget libraries required to run are shown on the PNG file. PHP, JavaScript, and HTML code is intended to be on a compatible web server. Also not included here are the PayPal client-ID and Database tables. Obviously those things would need to be set up by the user.
